                    <p class="card-text">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was the British wizarding school,
                        located in the Scottish Highlands. It accepted magical students from Great Britain and
                        Ireland for enrolment. It was a state-owned school, funded by the Ministry of Magic. The precise
                        location of the school could never be uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable. To Muggles,
                        the school appeared to be an old, abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools' locations
                        were protected in order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the
                        students and schools themselves from any harm. Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts was
                        considered to be one of the finest magical institutions in the Wizarding World, though other
                        notable schools included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France, the Durmstrang Institute
                        implied
                        to be in northern Europe, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the United States.
                        Children with magical abilities were enrolled at birth, and acceptance was confirmed by owl post
                        at
                        age eleven. However, if the child in question was a Muggle-born, a staff member from the school
                        visited
                        the child and his or her family in order to inform them of their magical heritage and the
                        existence of
                        the Wizarding world. The school's motto was Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus (Draco Dormiens
                        Nvnqvam
                        Titillandvs), which, translated from Latin, means "Never tickle a sleeping dragon".</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Diagon Alley is a cobblestoned wizarding alley and shopping area located in
                        London,
                        England behind a pub called the Leaky Cauldron. Inside the alley is an assortment of
                        restaurants,
                        shops, and other sights. All items on the Hogwarts supply list can be bought at Diagon Alley.
                        The
                        alley is completely hidden from the Muggle world which is right outside of its boundaries. It is
                        very large in area and essentially the centre of wizarding London</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Platform Nine and Three-Quarters (Platform 9¾) was a platform at King's Cross
                        Station in London. Magically concealed behind the barrier between Muggle Platforms Nine and Ten,
                        this Platform was where Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry students boarded the Hogwarts
                        Express every 1 September, in order to attend school.

                        In order for someone to get onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, they had to walk directly at
                        the apparently solid barrier dividing Platforms Nine and Ten.[1] When returning from Platform
                        Nine and Three-Quarters, there was a guard stationed just outside the ticket barrier, in order
                        to regulate exits from the platform through the gate, in order to not alarm the Muggles.</p>

                        the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry grounds. The forest is a very old place that
                        holds many secrets and houses many creatures, some dark and dangerous, others friendly. The
                        trees in the forest are considered ancient, they are dense and rough looking from years of
                        exposure to the elements. As the forest's name suggests, it is strictly off limits to students
                        — except in the case of detention, or Care of Magical Creatures lessons that occasionally take
                        place there. Of course, with the various dangerous creatures living in the Forest, few students
                        would even want to venture into it</p>
