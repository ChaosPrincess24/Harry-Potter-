    <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Ravenclaw is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
            Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house are 
            characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol is 
            an eagle, and blue and bronze are its colours. The Head of Ravenclaw is Filius 
            Flitwick, and the house ghost is the Grey Lady, otherwise known as the 
            daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, Helena Ravenclaw. Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the 
            element of air, and it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen; blue and 
            bronze represent the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air.
            The Ravenclaw points hourglass contains blue sapphires.</p>

    <h1>Common Room</h1>
        <p>The Ravenclaw common room is in one of the castle's towers and is wide and circular. You 
            have to climb a tight spiral staircase to get there. It has graceful arched windows, and 
            the walls are hung with blue and bronze silks. The domed ceiling is painted with stars, 
            which are echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. Tables, chairs, and bookcases cover the expanse 
            of the floor, and a white marble statue of Rowena Ravenclaw sits next to the door that leads 
            to the dormitories above. Harry Potter entered the common room in 1998 while searching for 
            clues to the location of one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Unlike the other common rooms in the 
            school, a logical riddle given by a bronze eagle-shaped knocker must be answered to enter.
            This could prove troublesome as anyone with enough intellect could intrude into the dormitory, 
            as is shown in 1998 where Professor McGonagall had no trouble entering by answering the riddle 
            correctly (though she was a "hatstall" between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw). On the other hand, 
            a particularly poorly-phrased riddle might bemuse a particular student, blocking them from entering 
            and forcing them to sleep outside. However, Hermione stated in her first year when figuring out the 
            complicated riddle, beneath the trapdoor, that most wizards and witches do not have much sense of 
            logic, which might be something that Ravenclaw noticed herself and decided to use clever riddles 
            instead of passwords, as they are safer than some words.</p>

        <h1>Reputation</h1>
            <p>According to Slytherin prefect Gemma Farley, Ravenclaws are so competitive when it comes to 
                academic success that they are known to backstab each other, and likely other students, in 
                order to get top marks. While Hufflepuff prefect Gabriel Truman noted that they are so proud 
                of the success of famous members, such as Laverne de Montmorency, that they claim any intelligent 
                wizard as a member of Ravenclaw House, such as Bridget Wenlock, who was, in fact, a Hufflepuff. 
                Some Ravenclaws, such as Uric the Oddball, Xenophilius Lovegood, and his daughter Luna Lovegood 
                are also noted to have a propensity towards eccentricity. Ravenclaw House appears to have little 
                rivalry with the other houses, except in Quidditch. Harry Potter believed that they tended to side 
                with Gryffindor in its rivalry with Slytherin, as did Hufflepuff house. However, during the 
                1994 Triwizard Tournament, most Ravenclaws supported Hufflepuff Champion Cedric Diggory over Harry. 
                They believed that Harry had, in fact, cheated his way into being a champion and that the true 
                Hogwarts champion was Cedric. Many Ravenclaws (such as Cho Chang) joined Dumbledore's Army 
                and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts along with Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs. They rose at almost 
                the exact moment as the Hufflepuffs and turned their wands upon Pansy Parkinson and Slytherin House 
                in Harry Potter's defence when the former wished to hand Harry over to Lord Voldemort and his army 
                of Death Eaters. Within the house, though, theyâ€™re well-known for being welcoming and encouraging 
                of creativity, eccentricity, and individuality and being very accepting.</p>

        <h1>Traits</h1>
            <p>Ravenclaw House prizes learning, wisdom, wit, and intellect in its members. Thus, many Ravenclaws 
                tend to be academically motivated and talented students. They also pride themselves on being original 
                in their ideas, and methods. It is not unusual to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different 
                types of magic that other houses might shun. Hermione Granger, an extremely intelligent witch and the 
                top student in her year, was sorted into Gryffindor, though she admitted that the Sorting Hat had seriously 
                considered placing her in Ravenclaw. Often hard-working and diligent, as often is the case with intellectuals 
                with a predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle are known to be 
                inclined to dismiss certain social expectations for the sake of satisfying their own intellectual curiosity. 
                Some of these eventually also ended up being not only accepted but even celebrated, in spite of being initially 
                subjected to scorn for their various oddities. Luna Lovegood, for example, was one such student: Eccentric to 
                put it at its mildest, she was a Ravenclaw student who initially was bullied for her open defiance of 
                conventionality, but ultimately became a celebrated wizarding naturalist and renowned for her participation 
                in the legendary Battle of Hogwarts and past membership in Dumbledore's Army. Another example would be Professor 
                Filius Flitwick, a half-goblin who might have faced scorn for his short stature earlier in life but went on to 
                become a renowned Duelling Champion, and subsequently one of the finest and most knowledgable Charms Masters in 
                the entirety of the wizarding world during his employment at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. (The 
                best, according to some of his students). Ravenclaws tend to be curious about the world and pay attention to 
                the world around them. Ravenclaws are known to be logical and rational. In addition, Ravenclaw students tend 
                to have abilities regarding Memory. Garrick Ollivander, for example, possessed an eidetic memory and can remember 
                every wand he has sold, and Gilderoy Lockhart had an exceptional talent in the Memory Charm. Even so, not 
                all Ravenclaws were motivated by academic prowess. Examples of such individuals included Gilderoy Lockhart and 
                Cho Chang, both of whom sought to use the good name and renown of their house, the inherent expectations of 
                certain academic prowess that comes with being sorted into it as well as the often somewhat natural ability 
                of its members to gain popularity among their peers, which particularly was the case of the former, proving 
                true the fact that a good student did not necessarily make a good witch or wizard. Minerva McGonagall was a 
                Hatstall, having approximately equal Ravenclaw and Gryffindor traits; the Sorting Hat finally Sorted her into 
                Gryffindor. Hermione Granger was also considered for Ravenclaw due to her intelligence, but the hat 
                ultimately decided on Gryffindor once again.[24] Filius Flitwick was in the same situation at the time of his 
                Sorting, but in his case the Hat decided on Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor.</p>
