    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Slytherin is one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
        founded by Salazar Slytherin. In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the
        Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most valued.
        Those characteristics include cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition. Many
        Slytherin students tend to clique together, often acquiring leaders, which further
        exemplifies Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of these include Draco Malfoy’s
        Gang and the Death Eaters. The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students
        and the Sorting Hat admitted that it can be a factor when being sorted. Students of any
        blood status can now be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-Born student from that house
        is considered to be quite rare. The emblematic animal of the house is a snake and its colours
        are green and silver. There were two notable heads of the house; Horace Slughorn took the
        role twice (first leaving in 1981 and then taking the role again from 1997 until leaving
        before 2016), and Severus Snape. The patron ghost of the house is the Bloody Baron.
        Slytherin corresponds roughly with the element of water due to serpents being commonly
        associated with the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as well as serpents being
        physically fluid and flexible animals. Similarly, in Celtic mythology, water is seen as a
        portal to another world, leading some to speculate that the element was chosen to symbolise
        many Slytherins' hope for a pure-blood only community. The colours also correspond with waters
        around lakes and lochs often being green, and silver being often associated with grey rainwater.
        This created great controversy at Hogwarts and it was the root of a feud between former friends
        Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor. Slytherin later decided to leave the school when an argument
        started between him and Gryffindor, and they either duelled or started a civil war between the
        two houses. Such an argument would be forever known as the origin of the feud between their two
        houses and also made them the houses that are most competitive. When Slytherin departed Hogwarts,
        he would leave behind the Chamber of Secrets with the purpose of an heir opening the chamber one
        day and unleashing a means of purging the school of those who, in his view, were unworthy to study
        magic: Muggle-borns. The chamber was opened twice and the Serpent of Slytherin was killed the
        second time by Harry Potter in 1992. Slytherin’s views at the time could be attributed to the
        persecution of witches and wizards at the hand of Muggles during that century.</p>

    <h1>Common Room</h1>
    <p>The Slytherin common room is in the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle and underneath the Black Lake.
        Because of this, the light in the common room is green. Harry Potter along with Ron Weasley
        entered the common room in his second year to find out if Draco Malfoy was the one opening the
        Chamber of Secrets. To enter the Slytherin common room one must merely speak aloud the current
        password in front of a stretch of a damp stone wall; once the word is uttered a concealed stone
        door will slide aside leaving a rectangular hole in the wall leading to the Slytherin common room.
        The only known Slytherin password is "pureblood", used in 1992.[13]</p>

    <h1>Reputation</h1>
    <p>Slytherin has a well-known reputation for creating dark witches and wizards that many would even
        say that every dark witch or wizard was actually in Slytherin.[26] (It also didn’t help that Voldemort
        himself was in Slytherin too when he was a student at Hogwarts) While it is true that many were in the
        house, it is untrue to say every single one of them was, as Peter Pettigrew, betrayer of James and Lily,
        was in Gryffindor and Quirinus Quirrell was in Ravenclaw. It appears that reputation has led to an ironic
        prejudice against the entire house. It is unknown how many dark witches and wizards were from this house
        before Tom Riddle began recruiting Death Eaters but many of them came from a family that valued blood
        purity and would prefer, like Riddle, to be in the house and recruit from there. In fairer terms, there
        were many good witches and wizards in the house who opposed the use of the Dark Arts, as well as
        discrimination based on blood purity, such as Horace Slughorn, Andromeda Tonks, and Leta Lestrange.
        Andromeda was related to many dark witches and wizards, such as her own sister Bellatrix Lestrange, and
        brother-in-law Lucius Malfoy, but she chose to forsake the loyalty to her family in favour of marrying the
        Muggle-born Ted Tonks. Leta was quite different from the majority of her family with her kind - albeit
        self-deprecating and bitter - personality, her love for both Newt Scamander and Theseus Scamander, her
        career ambition without ruthlessness, and her self-sacrificing bravery in the face of Gellert Grindelwald,
        in stark contrast to the usually compassionate Queenie of house Pukwudgie, who joined Grindelwald rather
        quickly. Also, the allegiance of Severus Snape was found to ultimately be towards Albus Dumbledore to the
        point of serving as a triple agent for the Order of the Phoenix, in stark contrast to Peter Pettigrew, the
        former Gryffindor who became a double agent for the Death Eaters instead. Merlin (of King Arthur fame) was
        also a Slytherin. It might also be possible (though quite unlikely) that the Sorting Hat simply sorts
        anyone with ill intentions into Slytherin, regardless of whether they possess cunning and ambition, which
        helped to unfairly give this house a bad name. Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle were both incredibly stupid
        and did not have clever or cunning minds, but were still sorted into Slytherin. They could have possessed one
        of the minor traits as even Peter Pettigrew was not placed into Gryffindor for bravery, but for chivalry
        instead. It is also likely that Crabbe and Goyle were simply placed there by process of elimination since
        they exhibited virtually none of the qualities valued by any of the other houses (lacking the work ethic or
        honesty of Hufflepuff, the academic prowess of Ravenclaw, or the bravery of Gryffindor). The Sorting Hat simply
        could have taken into account what house they wished to be placed in which, with their family history, was most
        likely Slytherin. The behaviour of Slytherin house at the Battle of Hogwarts is also debated. The majority of
        their members departed Hogwarts before the battle started and a few joined their families in becoming Death
        Eaters. However, many of them returned to Hogwarts to fight against the Death Eaters and were led back by
        their Head of House, Horace Slughorn.</p>

    <h1>Traits</h1>
    <p>
        Slytherins tend to be ambitious, shrewd, cunning, strong leaders, and achievement-oriented.
        They also have highly developed senses of self-preservation.[10] This means that Slytherins
        tend to hesitate before acting, so as to weigh all possible outcomes before deciding exactly
        what should be done. According to Albus Dumbledore, the qualities which Salazar valued in the
        students he had chosen included cleverness, resourcefulness, determination, and "a certain
        disregard for the rules." Dumbledore noted that all of these were qualities possessed by Harry
        Potter, who was a Gryffindor but was almost placed in Slytherin. Slytherins tend to take charge
        and possess strong leadership skills. They are often self-assured and confident of their own
        competence and can be very loyal. Another characteristic some Slytherins share is a tendency
        towards deep, unrequited love. Severus Snape and The Bloody Baron held abiding but unreturned
        feelings for Lily Evans and Helena Ravenclaw, respectively. Although some Slytherins,
        such as Tom Riddle, were incapable of feeling love at all, those that did were known to cherish
        their passion abidingly and unconditionally, although often tragically due to an inability to act
        appropriately on their feelings. Interestingly, Bellatrix Lestrange held feelings for Tom Riddle
        himself, which was a factor in her fanatical devotion to the Death Eaters; although Lord Voldemort
        was incapable of loving her in return, the existence of Delphini suggests that there was at least
        some kind of intimacy between them. Although Merope Riddle likely never attended Hogwarts and
        therefore wouldn't have been sorted into Slytherin at all, she was a descendant of Slytherin
        himself and fit the pattern of those sorted into his house, as she held deep and unreturned
        feelings for Tom Riddle Snr, who often travelled by her house on his carriage.</p>
