    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Hufflepuff is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
        Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff is the most
        inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty,
        and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. The emblematic animal
        is a badger, and yellow and black are its colours. The Head of Hufflepuff is Pomona
        Sprout and the Fat Friar is the House's patron ghost. Hufflepuff corresponds roughly
        to the element of earth, and it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen:
        yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil. The Hufflepuff point
        hourglass contains yellow diamonds. Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrate
        exceptional abilities in Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.</p>


    <h1>Common Room</h1>
    <p>The Hufflepuff dormitories and common room have never been seen by outsiders and is
        the only house with repelling devices in case of intruders. They are accessed through
        a pile of large barrels, found stacked in a shadowy stone recess on a right-hand side
        corridor near the kitchens. The barrel two from the bottom, middle of the second row,
        will open if tapped in the rhythm of 'Helga Hufflepuff'. As a security device to repel
        non-Hufflepuff students, tapping on the wrong barrel, or tapping the incorrect number
        of times, results in one of the other lids bursting off, drenching the impostor in
        vinegar. However, once you make it through the tunnel entryway, the Hufflepuff dormitory
        is a quite cosy and welcoming place; it always feels sunny. The common room is a large,
        earthy, round room with low ceilings. The view from the round windows is of dandelions and
        rippling grass. The decor emphasises the earthy-feel of the room with plants hanging and
        resting all about the room, some that even sing and dance. Burnished copper touchings with
        plush, cosy yellow and black patterned sofas and chairs welcome Hufflepuff students to relax
        and discuss the interesting specimens brought in by the Head of House, Professor Sprout. A
        Hufflepuff student retires through big, round doors in the walls of the common room to their
        dormitory.</p>

    <h1>Reputation</h1>
    <p>According to Minerva McGonagall, all four of the houses have produced exceptional witches
        and wizards in their time, but due to Helga Hufflepuff's policy of accepting any student
        Hufflepuff is often thought to be the house of less talented wizards and witches. However,
        this is merely a misunderstanding of the Sorting Hat's poem. The Hufflepuff house has produced
        a great many of successful and influential members of the wizarding world, such as the famous
        Magizoologist Newton Scamander. A great number of exceptionally skilled witches and wizards also
        have their origins on this house, including noted Arithmancer Bridget Wenlock, and former Minister
        for Magic Artemisia Lufkin. What makes Hufflepuff differ from the other houses is the fact that
        they don't tend to boast about these accomplishments; it is not considered to be part of their
        nature. Hufflepuff is the house that produced the fewest dark wizards throughout its history.
        Their cheerful and friendly demeanour can probably account for this property of the House.
        Hufflepuff firmly demonstrated its loyalty during the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, when they were
        second only to Harry Potter's own house of Gryffindor in the number of students willing to stay and
        fight against Voldemort and his forces in the defence of their school.</p>

    <h1>Traits</h1>
    <p>Students belonging to this house are known to be hard-working, friendly, loyal, honest and rather
        impartial. It may be that due to their values, Hufflepuffs are not as competitive as the other
        houses, and are more modest about their accomplishments. Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among
        the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a
        particular aptitude in its students. Hufflepuffs are known to have a strong moral code, and a
        sense of right and wrong. Hufflepuffs are usually accepting of everyone. Students in Hufflepuff
        are known to value everyone and treat them as equal. Hufflepuff appears to have the least rivalry
        with the other houses, except in Quidditch, although the Triwizard Tournament did temporarily put
        a great deal of strain on the relationship between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, due to unusual
        circumstances of the selection of both Gryffindor student Harry Potter and Hufflepuff student
        Cedric Diggory as Champions. This was mended by 1998, where a majority of Hufflepuffs rose
        to defend Harry from Pansy Parkinson and later helped to defend Hogwarts.</p>
